# Moving Car Simulation  

The **Moving Car Simulation** is a simple yet engaging C++ program that demonstrates a 2D animated car using graphics programming. It enables users to control the car's speed interactively, providing smooth animations and real-time updates. This project is designed as a learning tool for students, helping them explore graphics libraries and foundational programming concepts in C++.
